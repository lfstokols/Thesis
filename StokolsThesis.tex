\begin{acknowledgments}		% Optional
\index{Acknowledgments@\emph{Acknowledgments}}%
Thank you to my committee, and especially to my advisor Alexis Vasseur who has been a better mentor than I could have hoped for.  He has kept me on the right path at all times and shown me how to be a better mathematician.   

Thank you to my family, Mark and Niki and Caleb and Max, for their love and support over the years.  Everything else is possible because I already know they'll always be there.  

Thank you to the UT Math community, the many graduate students who kept me sane along the way.  I am lucky that my friends here at UT are too numerous to mention, but you know who you are. Thank you to Matt Novack, Sean Carney, Dan Weser, Andy Ma, Nick Bhattacharya, Matt Rosenzweig, Michael Hott, Sam Krupa, and Will Golding for being excellent resources as I struggled to learn what PDE are and how in the hell they work.  

Before arriving at UT, many people helped to foster my love of mathematics.  Thank you to Jenny Harrison, my undergraduate advisor who gave me so much encouragement and invited me without hesitation into the exciting and dramatic world of professional mathematics.  Thank you to my aunt Sindi Miller, my ``proto-advisor,'' who guided me when I was just a high school student who dreamt of becoming a mathematician.  Lastly, thank you to my high school geometry teacher Mrs. Williams, who told me to read Euclid.  I enjoyed it so much, look where it got me.

The De Giorgi method was developed in 1957 for showing continuity of non-linear elliptic problems.  In this work we will apply generalizations of that method to a variety of degenerate problems.  Such problems include first-order equations with negative viscosity, hypoelliptic equations including the nonlocal Focker-Planck equation, and transport-diffusion equations with boundary, for which the diffusion is of critical order and degenerates near the boundary.  We will also consider a separate problem in which energy techniques can be brought to bear on a hyperbolic problem, namely the stability of shocks to conservation laws.

% This allows quicker processing by the Makediss command file in case you
% are not working on a specific, long and slow to compile chapter. You
% can even change the chapter order by merely interchanging the order
% of the include statements (something I found helpful in my own
% dissertation).

%Craig William McCluskey
%was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on 20 May 1950, the son of
%Dr. William R. McCluskey and Lucilla W. McCluskey.  He received the Bachelor
%of Science degree in Engineering from the California Institute of Technology
%and was commissioned an Officer in the United States Air Force in 1971.
%He entered active duty in October, 1971, and was stationed in Denver, Colorado,
%Colorado Springs, Colorado, Panama City, Florida, and Sacramento, California.
%He separated from the USAF in 1975 and worked as an engineer for several small
%electronics companies in California before moving to Colorado Springs, Colorado
%to work for Hewlett-Packard in 1979. He left Hewlett-Packard in 1989 and joined
%a small company based in Herndon, Virginia, working out of his house as a
%``remote'' engineer designing parts of the Alexis satellite for Los Alamos
%National Laboratories. Laid off when his portion of the satellite was
%completed, he applied to the University of Texas at Austin for enrollment
%in their physics program. He was accepted and started graduate studies in
%August, 1991.
