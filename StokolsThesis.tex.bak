The De Giorgi method was developed in 1957 for showing continuity of non-linear elliptic problems.  In this work we will apply generalizations of that method to a variety of degenerate problems.  Such problems include first-order equations with negative viscosity, hypoelliptic equations including the nonlocal Focker-Planck equation, and transport-diffusion equations with boundary, for which the diffusion is of critical order and degenerates near the boundary.  We will also consider a separate problem in which energy techniques can be brought to bear on a hyperbolic problem, namely the stability of shocks to conservation laws.

% Including external files for each chapter makes this document simpler,

% with as few as zero chapters (by commenting out the include statements).
% This allows quicker processing by the Makediss command file in case you
% are not working on a specific, long and slow to compile chapter. You
% can even change the chapter order by merely interchanging the order
% of the include statements (something I found helpful in my own
% dissertation).

%Craig William McCluskey
%was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on 20 May 1950, the son of
%Dr. William R. McCluskey and Lucilla W. McCluskey.  He received the Bachelor
%of Science degree in Engineering from the California Institute of Technology
%and was commissioned an Officer in the United States Air Force in 1971.
%He entered active duty in October, 1971, and was stationed in Denver, Colorado,
%Colorado Springs, Colorado, Panama City, Florida, and Sacramento, California.
%He separated from the USAF in 1975 and worked as an engineer for several small
%electronics companies in California before moving to Colorado Springs, Colorado
%to work for Hewlett-Packard in 1979. He left Hewlett-Packard in 1989 and joined
%a small company based in Herndon, Virginia, working out of his house as a
%``remote'' engineer designing parts of the Alexis satellite for Los Alamos
%National Laboratories. Laid off when his portion of the satellite was
%completed, he applied to the University of Texas at Austin for enrollment
%in their physics program. He was accepted and started graduate studies in
%August, 1991.
